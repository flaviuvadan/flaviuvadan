      I realized the importance of having diversified interests in an attempt to accumulate lessons from different
      fields and by hearing others (podcasts) recommending the adoption of it. I value open-sourced information and
      how people share lessons they learned through podcasts, books, blogs, etc. To showcase appreciation for all the
      resources I have access to, I decided to compile a list of the things I use/d for my own learning so others can
      develop awareness of them the same way I did. The compiled lists are in no particular order, are not
      comprehensive, and I will update them occasionally as I complete readings, discover interesting podcasts or
      unsubscribe to some, continue listening to audio books.
