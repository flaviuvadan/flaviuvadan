I decided to create my own website to have a medium to share some thing I would like to. The website includes a brief personal introduction on the 
homepage and other links to the blog (under construction) and the learning section (under construction).

### About
- personal introduction
### Blog (might add this later)
- things I would like to share ranging from life lessons to technical things on software development and bioinformatics
### Learning
- Learning resources I come across ranging from hardcover/audio books to podcasts, videos, etc
